# *Introduction* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/f963cbe0-2639-4950-81d2-6f41e4f9a7f5">
Our project involves revitalizing a previously abandoned application for a new client. The application is currently in an incomplete design phase, with mockups lacking a clear user flow and style guidelines. Our task is to rescue the project, refining the design for aesthetics and usability and completing the entire application.

# *Description of the project* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/53786f41-5b13-4265-a20d-a478d3aaff27">
As Fullstack developers, we will use a framework to build the application. It will offer essential functionalities for end-users, such as adding dishes to a shopping cart, viewing the cart, and placing orders. Superadmins will manage dishes, categorize them, and handle order reception. Additional features include dish ratings, favorites, user registration, and login.

The technical requirements include a minimum 50% QA coverage, backend development using PHP Laravel, MySQL database, web interface with Blade and CSS frameworks, MVC architecture, and form validation. We will use Git for version control and Trello for project management.

Our goal is to deliver a fully functional application with an improved user experience while adhering to technical specifications.<br>

An example of how our project looks like can be found in the following image:

- Add dish: users CAN add new dishes to the shopping cart.
- View shopping cart: Users WILL have constant access to the shopping cart to monitor the selected dishes, in list format.
- Delete dish: users CAN delete dishes from the shopping cart, one by one or several at a time.
- Filter dishes: users CAN sort items by price and type (e.g. meat, fish, a specific ingredient...).
- Place the order: users CAN validate the order.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
Laravel has the most extensive and thorough documentation and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the Laravel Bootcamp, where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
